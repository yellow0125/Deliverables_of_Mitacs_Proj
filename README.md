 ## ðŸ™Œ Reflection  

Working on this project has been both challenging and rewarding.  

- The technical side pushed us to explore cutting-edge models like **Mask2Former**, while still leveraging more traditional architectures like **U-Net** for comparison.  
- There were difficulties with **dataset imbalance, annotation work, and high-resolution UAV imagery**, but tackling these made the models stronger and the research more meaningful.  
- Weekly discussions and collaboration helped shape the direction of the work and kept the focus on practical applications, such as **real-time wildfire monitoring**.  

**On a personal note**
 
 Tracy:
 this project has been a valuable learning journey. I not only strengthened my skills in **computer vision and AI research**, but also learned the importance of **teamwork, communication, and persistence** when challenges arose.  It was inspiring to work on a project that has real-world impact, especially in the critical area of wildfire prevention and risk management. I feel proud of what we achieved together as a team. While there are always areas to improve, the project represents a solid foundation for future research and applications.
