 ## 🙌 Reflection  

##### 👩‍💻Tracy
Working on this project has been both challenging and rewarding.  

- On the technical side, we explored advanced models like **Mask2Former**, and also used classic ones like **U-Net** for comparison.  This helped me better understand **image segmentation** and how it applies in real-world situations.
- We faced real challenges— **dataset imbalance**, **time-consuming annotation**, and **the complexity of high-resolution UAV imagery**. Dealing with **oblique images** also brought unexpected issues like distortion, occlusion, and lighting changes. These problems weren’t easy, but solving them taught me a lot and made our models stronger.
- Weekly discussions and collaboration helped shape the direction of the work and kept the focus on practical applications. 
- What made this project stand out for me was **the sense of purpose**. Forest fires are real, urgent problems. Knowing that this project might actually help with early detection made it more than just an academic exercise—it felt relevant. 
- This project has been a meaningful learning experience. I’ve grown not only in my AI and computer vision skills, but also in how I approach teamwork, communication, and persistence—especially when things got tough. There’s still plenty of room to improve, but I’m proud of what we’ve built so far.
