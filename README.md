 ## üôå Reflection  

##### üë©‚ÄçüíªTracy
Working on this project has been both challenging and rewarding.  

- On the technical side, we explored advanced models like **Mask2Former**, and also used classic ones like **U-Net** for comparison.  This helped me better understand **image segmentation** and how it applies in real-world situations.
- We faced real challenges‚Äî **dataset imbalance**, **time-consuming annotation**, and **the complexity of high-resolution UAV imagery**. Dealing with **oblique images** also brought unexpected issues like distortion, occlusion, and lighting changes. These problems weren‚Äôt easy, but solving them taught me a lot and made our models stronger.
- Weekly discussions and collaboration helped shape the direction of the work and kept the focus on practical applications. 
- What made this project stand out for me was **the sense of purpose**. Forest fires are real, urgent problems. Knowing that this project might actually help with early detection made it more than just an academic exercise‚Äîit felt relevant. 
- This project has been a meaningful learning experience. I‚Äôve grown not only in my AI and computer vision skills, but also in how I approach teamwork, communication, and persistence‚Äîespecially when things got tough. There‚Äôs still plenty of room to improve, but I‚Äôm proud of what we‚Äôve built so far.

Working on this project has been a valuable and rewarding research experience. The collaboration within our team played a key role in accelerating the research process and enabling us to develop better solutions. Each member‚Äôs expertise contributed to refining the methodology and strengthening the overall study. In addition, collaborating with external partners to obtain the drone data was essential for achieving the project‚Äôs objectives, as access to high-quality data directly influenced the accuracy and reliability of our findings.  

Through this project, I dedicated my efforts to ensure the best possible outcomes, not only by contributing to technical aspects but also by supporting the integration of ideas and resources. I have learned the importance of both internal teamwork and external collaboration in driving research success.
